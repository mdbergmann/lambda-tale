# Auto-review gate (pre-commit) — Lambda's Tale engine edition, ported from
# the Closure game's gate (itself ported from cl-amiga).
#
# Reviews the STAGED diff with a headless `claude`. If the review is clean the
# commit proceeds untouched. If it finds problems and AUTO_FIX is on, a fix
# agent edits the affected files, the fixes are re-staged, and the commit
# proceeds WITH the fixes included.
#
# Design principles:
#   * Review + tests are MANDATORY. Fail-CLOSED: a reviewer error, timeout, or
#     missing tool BLOCKS the commit — it is never silently skipped. The only
#     bypass is an explicit `git commit --no-verify`.
#   * The staged diff is written to a file and the reviewer is told to READ it
#     (with Read+Bash tools), NOT piped on stdin. Headless `claude -p` stalls
#     when a large diff arrives on stdin and it must answer in a single shot;
#     reading the diff as a file lets the agent work through it reliably.
#   * Never sweep in changes the user didn't stage (partial-staging guard).
#
# Override behaviour via env vars (see scripts/review/README.md):
#   CLAUDE_AUTO_REVIEW=0   disable entirely (or use `git commit --no-verify`)
#   CLAUDE_AUTO_FIX=0      review + block on issues, but don't auto-fix
#   CLAUDE_REVIEW_MODEL    default: sonnet
#   CLAUDE_FIX_MODEL       default: sonnet
#   CLAUDE_REVIEW_TIMEOUT  default: 5400  (seconds = 90 min, if `timeout`/`gtimeout`
#                          exists; the agentic Read+grep review and the fix agent
#                          can each take many minutes on a large multi-file diff)
#
# Note: --max-budget-usd is intentionally NOT passed. It only caps pay-per-token
# API-call spend (and only with --print); it does nothing for a subscription
# (claude.ai) login, which is metered by plan rate limits, not dollars.

REVIEW_PROMPT='You are reviewing a git diff for a commit about to be made to Lambda'\''s Tale, a Bard'\''s Tale-style dungeon-crawler ENGINE in pure Common Lisp, running on AmigaOS via the clamiga runtime. Games (e.g. Closure) live in sibling repos and load the engine; this repo holds mechanics only. The staged diff to review is in the file '"$DIFF_FILE"' — read that file first.

Enforce these project rules (from CLAUDE.md) and review dimensions:
- Common Lisp conformance: all Lisp must conform to the HyperSpec — no implementation-specific extensions, no undefined behaviour (e.g. modifying literal data, relying on evaluation order the standard leaves open). This code doubles as a conformance probe for the clamiga runtime.
- Common Lisp quality: code must be readable, maintainable, idiomatic CL — conventional naming (*special-variables*, +constants+, -p/-P predicates), the construct that fits (LOOP/DOLIST/MAP, multiple values, the condition system over ad-hoc error codes), no needless mutation or cleverness, docstrings where a reader needs them.
- The engine ships no story: mechanics live here, content lives in a game repo. No story text, campaign data, item/spell/monster tables, map content or anything game-specific (Closure or otherwise) may enter the engine — when a game needs something the engine cannot express, the engine grows a MECHANISM (a define-* form, a cell-special op, an effect key) and the game supplies the data. A game-shaped name, table or constant in engine code is a finding. The engine'\''s own suite plays tests/world/, a minimal fixture — it must stay playable with no game present.
- Versioning discipline: a change in engine behaviour a game would notice needs a src/version.lisp bump in the same commit; +SAVE-VERSION+ in src/save.lisp moves ONLY when the save-file format actually changes — a format change without that bump, or a bump without a format change, is a finding.
- Amiga constraints: the engine runs on 68k AmigaOS under clamiga with a small heap and a 128K stack — watch for unbounded consing in per-turn/per-frame paths (rendering, the idle heartbeat, combat rounds), large intermediate lists, deep recursion, and anything else a 7 MHz-class machine or an 8M heap cannot afford.
- Tests are the specification: every feature and bug fix needs a check in tests/run-tests.lisp (harness: check, check-true, check-error, with-rng, watch-messages), and tests must be tight — exact expected values, edge cases and error paths, not just the happy path.
- README.md stays current, user-facing and high-level — no changelog notes or internal detail.

Output format, STRICTLY:
- The FIRST line must be exactly "STATUS: CLEAN" or "STATUS: ISSUES".
- If ISSUES, follow with a markdown list, one item per finding:
  "- [HIGH|MED|LOW] path:line - problem - suggested fix"
- Report ONLY substantive problems (bugs, HyperSpec deviations, unidiomatic or unmaintainable Lisp, data/engine boundary violations, hand-edited generated files, canon drift, Amiga memory/performance hazards, missing/incorrect tests). No style nits beyond the idiom rules above, no speculation.
- Read the diff file and any surrounding source files you need for context (Read tool); you may grep the tree via Bash to verify claims. Do NOT edit anything.'

# No stdin: the diff is read from $DIFF_FILE. Redirect </dev/null so headless
# claude doesn't wait on (or block reading) an empty stdin. Read+Bash only, so
# the agent can read the diff/sources and grep, but cannot edit or run amok.

- Make minimal, correct fixes. Follow CLAUDE.md: HyperSpec-conforming, idiomatic Common Lisp; the engine ships mechanics only — no story or game-specific data ever enters this repo; bump src/version.lisp when behaviour a game would notice changed (and +SAVE-VERSION+ only on a real save-format change); respect Amiga memory/stack constraints; add/adjust tests in tests/run-tests.lisp when the finding calls for it (only within the listed files).
- Then append under that finding in the log: "  - RESOLVED: <what you changed>". If a finding is a false positive, append "  - DISMISSED: <why>" and change no code for it.
- Do NOT run git and do NOT commit. Only edit files and update the log.'
