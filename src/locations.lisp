;;; Lambda's Tale — locations: shops and other enterable places.
;;;
;;; A location is map data: the special op
;;;     (location TITLE KIND ARG...)
;;; attached to a cell (a building's door square in a city, a hut in a
;;; dungeon).  Stepping onto the cell enters the location: the game
;;; gains a modal LOCATION state (like combat), the front-ends switch to
;;; its menu.  KIND is an open set; the engine ships mechanics for
;;; :SHOP (ARG... is :stock (ITEM-NAME...); stock is unlimited, Bard's
;;; Tale style).  Unknown kinds still enter/leave cleanly — campaigns
;;; script them via the :ENTER-LOCATION event.
;;;
;;; The interaction itself is modeled here too, platform-free: a
;;; SHOP-VIEW holds the UI state (which hero is shopping, buy or sell
;;; page), SHOP-LINES renders the menu as text lines and SHOP-ACT maps
;;; a key press to mechanics — both front-ends drive the same model, so
;;; the whole shop flow is testable on the host without a UI.
