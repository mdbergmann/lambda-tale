;;; Lambda's Tale — spells.
;;;
;;; Spell types are campaign data, not engine facts: the campaign
;;; registers them with DEFINE-SPELL in its campaign.lisp;
;;; the engine only knows the mechanics.  Casters (hero classes with
;;; :CASTER T) pay spell points; SP regenerate while walking outdoors
;;; in daylight (see ADVANCE-TIME in time.lisp).
;;;
;;; A spell's effect is a plist over the shared effect vocabulary
;;; (game.lisp): the INSTANT keys (*INSTANT-EFFECT-KEYS* — the damage
;;; family, :heal/:heal-party/:resurrect, :scry, :summon ...) resolve
;;; at cast time; the TIMED keys (*TIMED-EFFECT-KEYS* — :buff-ac,
;;; :light, :compass, :buff-damage, :foes-ac ...) merge into one
;;; effect record via APPLY-EFFECT-SPEC, the funnel shared with usable
;;; items and songs.  Keys combine freely — a restoration heals AND
;;; cures; a batchspell installs five enchantments in one record.
;;; :IMAGE names the icon the effects band draws while a timed effect
;;; burns.
;;;
;;; Beside the mechanics a spell carries display metadata straight
;;; from the old lore: :CODE (the four-letter incantation, \"MAFL\"),
;;; :RANGE and :DURATION-TEXT (the spellbook's own words).  The
;;; engine stores and exposes them (SPELL-CODE, SPELL-RANGE,
;;; SPELL-DURATION-TEXT); the mechanics never read them.
;;;
;;; The cast interaction is modeled here too, platform-free (the
;;; SHOP-VIEW pattern): a CAST-VIEW holds the menu state, CAST-LINES
;;; renders it as text lines and CAST-ACT maps a key press to
;;; mechanics — both front-ends drive the same model.
