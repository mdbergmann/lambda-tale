;;; Lambda's Tale — combat.
;;;
;;; Monster types are campaign data (DEFINE-MONSTER); the engine only
;;; knows the mechanics.  Combat is Bard's Tale round-based: the party
;;; declares actions, heroes strike first, then every surviving monster
;;; swings at a random front-rank hero.  The whole transcript travels as
;;; :MESSAGE events; :COMBAT-START and :COMBAT-END frame the fight.
;;;
;;; To-hit: d20 + bonus hits when it reaches 20 - AC (descending AC,
;;; unarmored 10 = hit on 10+).  Defending is +4 AC for the round.
