;;; Lambda's Tale — engine version.
;;;
;;; One place holds the engine's version; anything that wants to report
;;; it (a title screen, a save stamp, a bug report) derives it from here
;;; instead of spelling out a number of its own.  The shape follows the
;;; repo's own convention — MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH plus a DD.MM.YYYY date,
;;; as in CL_VERSION_* in src/core/types.h.
;;;
;;; A GAME built on the engine carries its OWN version, independent of
;;; this one: the engine only declares the slots (*GAME-NAME* and
;;; friends, all NIL here) and each game's own version.lisp fills them
;;; in — see ../../closure-tale/src/version.lisp for the worked example.
;;;
;;; Loaded first after the package, so every later file may refer to it.
