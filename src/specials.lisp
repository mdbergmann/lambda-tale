;;; Lambda's Tale — cell specials.
;;;
;;; A special is a list of ops attached to a map cell — in the .map file
;;; after the art (see map.lisp) or via (SETF CELL-SPECIAL).  Ops are
;;; pure data interpreted here; map files are never evaluated.  The ops:
;;;
;;;   (message TEXT...)          show each TEXT (a :MESSAGE event)
;;;   (set-flag KEY) (clear-flag KEY)
;;;   (when-flag KEY OP...)      run OP... if story flag KEY is set
;;;   (unless-flag KEY OP...)    ... if it is not
;;;   (at-night OP...)           run OP... between 20:00 and 06:00
;;;   (at-day OP...)             ... between 06:00 and 20:00 (pure clock
;;;                              tests — zone darkness is irrelevant)
;;;   (once OP...)               run OP... only the first time ever
;;;                              (one ONCE per cell; keyed by map + cell)
;;;   (teleport X Y [FACING])    relocate the party; the target cell's
;;;                              special triggers too (depth-capped)
;;;   (travel FILE [X Y] [FACING])  move the party to another zone (map

;;;                              TRAVEL-PARTY in game.lisp)
;;;   (location TITLE KIND ARG...)  enter a location (shop, temple, ...)
;;;                              on this cell — see locations.lisp
;;;   (spin)                     face a random direction (silently —
;;;                              classic spinner squares)
;;;   (damage DICE [TEXT])       hurt every living hero (DICE each)
;;;   (heal DICE)                heal every living hero
;;;   (gold DICE)                treasure (goes to the leading hero)
;;;   (encounter (MONSTER COUNT)...)  start combat; ops after this one
;;;                              are skipped (combat interrupts)
;;;   (event TOPIC ARG...)       emit a story event for subscribers
